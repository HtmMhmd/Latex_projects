	\section{Introduction}
		Pulse modulation, demodulation, and transformations are key concepts in signal processing and communication systems. Pulse modulation involves encoding analog signals into pulse-based formats, facilitating efficient transmission and storage. Demodulation, on the other hand, allows for the extraction of original analog signals from modulated pulses, enabling signal reconstruction. Transformations among different pulse modulation techniques, such as Pulse Width Modulation (PWM), Pulse Position Modulation (PPM), and Pulse Code Modulation (PCM), play a crucial role in adapting and optimizing signal processing for diverse communication applications.
	\section{Types of Pulse Modulations and Demodulations}
	
	
	\subsection{Pulse Amplitude Modulation (PAM)}
	
	\subsubsection{Definition}
	 PAM is a modulation technique where the amplitude of the pulse is varied in proportion to the amplitude of the analog signal being transmitted.
	 
	 - In PAM, the modulated signal can be represented as:
	 \begin{equation}
		s(t) = A_m * m(t) * p(t)
	 \end{equation}
	 where:
	 \begin{align*}
	 	 A_m  & : \text{The amplitude of the pulse} \\
	 	 m(t) & : \text{The baseband signal} \\
	 	 p(t) & : \text{The pulse waveform}
	 \end{align*}
	 
	\subsubsection{Demodulation}
	 Demodulation of PAM involves detecting the amplitude variations of the modulated signal. This can be achieved using envelope detection or synchronous detection techniques.
	 - Demodulation of PAM can be achieved using envelope detection:
	  \begin{equation}
	 	m(t) = \frac{ 1}{A_m * s(t)}
	 \end{equation}
	 
	 \begin{align*}
	 	m(t)  & : \text{The demodulated baseband signal} \\
	 \end{align*}
	  
	\subsubsection{Application}
	PAM is commonly used in digital communication systems, audio signals, and radar systems.
	
	\subsubsection{Advantages}
	PAM is simple to implement and provides a straightforward way to transmit analog information digitally.
	
	\subsubsection{Disadvantages}
	 PAM is susceptible to noise and distortion during transmission due to its sensitivity to amplitude variations.
	
	
	\subsection{Pulse Width Modulation (PWM)}
	
	\subsubsection{Definition}
	PWM is a modulation technique where the width of the pulse is varied in proportion to the amplitude of the analog signal.
	
	- In PWM, the modulated signal can be represented as a train of pulses with varying widths:
	\begin{equation}
		s(t) = A_p \sum_n m(nT_s) * u(t - nT_s)
	\end{equation}
	where: 
	\begin{align*}
		A_p  & : \text{The amplitude of the pulse} \\
		m(nT_s) & : \text{The baseband signalat at time $nT_s$} \\
		u(t)  & : \text{The unit step function}
	\end{align*}
	
	\subsubsection{Demodulation}
	 Demodulation of PWM involves converting the pulse width variations back to the original analog signal. This is typically done using a low-pass filter to smooth out the pulse train.
	- Demodulation of PWM involves integrating the pulse train over each pulse width to recover the original signal:

	
	\begin{equation}
		m(t) = \int_{0}^{T_s} s(t - \tau) d\tau
	\end{equation}
	
	\subsubsection{Application}
	PWM is widely used in motor control, power electronics, and audio amplifiers.
	
	\subsubsection{Advantages}
	 PWM offers high efficiency, precise control over power output, and low distortion in audio applications.
	
	\subsubsection{Disadvantages}
	PWM can introduce high-frequency components that may require filtering, and it may be more complex to implement compared to other modulation techniques.
	
	\subsection{ Pulse Position Modulation (PPM)}
	
	\subsubsection{Definition}
	PPM is a modulation technique where the position of the pulse within a fixed time period is varied based on the analog signal.
	
	- In PPM, the modulated signal can be represented as a series of pulses with varying positions:

	\begin{equation}
		s(t) = A_p \sum_n m(nT_s) * \gamma (t - nT_s - t_0)
	\end{equation}
	where: \\
	\begin{align*}
		t_0  & : \text{The time offset for each pulse.} \\
	\end{align*}
	
	\subsubsection{Demodulation}
	Demodulation of PPM requires recovering the timing information encoded in the pulse positions. This can be accomplished by detecting the leading edges of the pulses and decoding the timing information.
	
	- Demodulation of PPM involves detecting the timing of the pulses to recover the original signal:
	
	\begin{equation}
		m(t) = s(nT_s + t_0)
	\end{equation}
	
	\subsubsection{Application}
	PPM is commonly used in radar systems, optical communication, and position sensing applications.
	
	\subsubsection{Advantages}
	PPM provides good resistance to noise and allows for efficient use of bandwidth by transmitting information only when needed.
	
	\subsubsection{Disadvantages}
	PPM can be sensitive to timing errors and requires accurate synchronization between transmitter and receiver.
	
	\subsection{Pulse Code Modulation (PCM)}
	
	\subsubsection{Definition}
	PCM is a modulation technique where an analog signal is sampled and quantized into discrete levels before being transmitted as digital codes.
	
	 - In PCM, the modulated signal consists of discrete levels representing digital codes:
	\begin{equation}
		s(t) = A_p * c[n] * p(t - nT_s)
	\end{equation}
	where: \\
	\begin{align*}
		c[n]  & : \text{The digital code at time $nT_s$.} \\
	\end{align*}
	
	\subsubsection{Demodulation}
	 Demodulation of PCM involves decoding the digital pulse code to reconstruct the original analog signal. This is done by converting the digital codes back to analog values using a digital-to-analog converter (DAC).
	- Demodulation of PCM involves decoding the digital codes to reconstruct the original analog signal using a DAC:
	\begin{equation}
		m(t) = D({c[n]})
	\end{equation}
	where: \\
	\begin{align*}
		D({\space})  & : \text{The digital-to-analog conversion function.} \\
	\end{align*}
	
	\subsubsection{Application}
	PCM is extensively used in telecommunications, digital audio recording, and data transmission systems.
	
	\subsubsection{Advantages}
	PCM offers high fidelity, robustness against noise, and compatibility with digital processing techniques.
	
	\subsubsection{Disadvantages}
	PCM requires higher bandwidth compared to analog transmission, and quantization errors can introduce distortion in the reconstructed signal.
	
	
	\section{Types of Pulse Transformations}
		Pulse Modulations transformations provide a systematic way to convert between different types of pulse modulation techniques while preserving the essential characteristics of the original signals. Understanding these transformations can help in designing and implementing complex communication systems that require interoperability between various modulation schemes.
	\subsection{Transformation from PAM to PWM}	
	 In this transformation, the amplitude of the PAM signal determines the duty cycle of the PWM signal. A threshold is set to determine when the PWM signal switches from low to high based on the PAM amplitude.
	 
	 -To convert a PAM signal to PWM, you can use the following equation:
	 \begin{equation}
	 {PWM}(t) = 
	 \begin{cases}
	 	1, & \text{if } {PAM}(t) > \text{threshold} \\
	 	0, & \text{otherwise}
	 \end{cases}
	 \end{equation}
	\subsection{Transformation from PAM to PPM}
	In this transformation, the timing of the pulse within a fixed time period is adjusted based on the amplitude of the PAM signal. A threshold is used to determine when the pulse should be positioned at $t_1$ or $t_0$.
	
	-To convert a PAM signal to PPM, you can use the following equation:
	\begin{equation}
	{PPM}(t) = 
	\begin{cases}
		t_1, & \text{if } \text{PAM}(t) > \text{threshold} \\
		t_0, & \text{otherwise}
	\end{cases}
	\end{equation}
	\subsection{Transformation from PAM to PCM}
	
	In this transformation, the continuous PAM signal is quantized into discrete levels using a quantization step size $\triangle$ . The rounded value of $PAM(t)/\triangle$ represents the PCM code for each sample.
	\begin{equation}
		PCM(t) = Round (\frac{PAM(t)}{\triangle})
	\end{equation}
	\subsection{Transformation from PWM to PPM}
		In this transformation, the duration for which the PWM signal is high or low within a fixed time period determines the position of the pulse in the PPM signal. Integration of the PWM signal helps in mapping the duty cycle to the pulse position.
	\begin{equation}
		{PPM}(t) = \int_{0}^{t} {PWM}(t) \, dt
	\end{equation}
	
	\subsection{Transformation from PWM to PCM}
	 In this transformation, the continuous PWM signal is sampled at a specific rate, and each sample is quantized into a PCM code. The quantization process assigns a digital code to each sample based on its amplitude.
	 \begin{equation}
	 	{PCM}[n] = \text{Quantize}\left({PWM}(nT)\right)
	 \end{equation}
	 where : 
	 $Quantize(Ip(nT))$ function that maps the continuous Input value at regular intervals $nT$
	 to a discrete level in The Output.
	 
	 
	 
	\subsection{Transformation from PPM to PCM}
		In this transformation, the timing of the pulses in the PPM signal is sampled at regular intervals, and each pulse position is quantized into a PCM code. The quantization process assigns digital codes based on the position of each pulse.
	 \begin{equation}
		{PCM}[n] = \text{Quantize}\left({PPM}(n\hat{T})\right)
	\end{equation}
	where :
	$Quantize(Ip(n\hat{T}))$ function that maps the continuous Input value at specific time instances $n\hat{T}$ to a discrete level in The Output.
